# UDP Client for NIST Time Servers

Instructions from professor:

Create a Java UDP client that’s capable of querying a public time server on the internet
to obtain the current date & time.
To find an internet time server, please see the following webpage:
[https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi](https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi)

The page lists several internet time servers hosted by NIST. 
For this project, you can use any of the servers that state “All services available” from the first table on the page.
